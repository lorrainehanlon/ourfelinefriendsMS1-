##Milestone Project 1 - User Centric Front-end Design

The brief is to build a static front-end site using HTML and CSS, and based on the principles of UX design. This website is for educational purposes.

##UX

###Project Goals
The goal of this site is to inform users about the work of the cat shelter and lead them to considering adopting a cat, making a charitable donation and getting in touch. Users will be encouraged to return to the site to see new cats that are available to adopt.  

###User Stories

1. As a potential cat adopter, I want to find about the organisation and the process involved in adopting a cat.
2. As a potential cat adoptor, I want to see pictures and find out about cats looking for a home.
3. As a potential cat adoptor, I want to know how to make contact to start the adoption process.
4. As a cat lover, I want to know how I can support this organisation in their work.
5. As a cat lover, I want to see lots of pictures of cats.
6. As a cat lover, I want to know about other ways I can follow the work of the organisation and the cats that are being saved from the streets.


###Design

####Typography
I have chosen Roboto as a clear informative font, this site aims to allow the user to quickly take in the information and move to the area of the site they require. 

####Colour scheme

####Imagery
I chose to have a large three picture carousel in my home page with images of the the cats that have been cared for at the cat shelter. It is bold and leaves the user in no doubt of what the site is about. Throughout the site further images of cats are used to inform the user about the cats that are currently available for adoption and to show the cats in happy condition now that they have been taken off the streets. 

###Wireframes
I created 3 wireframes to display the responsive design of my site - 


##Features
I decided to create a single page website with 3 sections rather than a 3 page site. I created sections for "who we are" "Adopt a cat" and "Support us". This leads the user through the story of how the shelter came to be, how to adopt a cat and the cats currently available and then if the user is not in a position to adopt, they can see other ways to support the shelter.

The site follows structured layout starting with a header with fixed navbar always available to the user as they scroll, allowing them to navigate easily to different parts of the site. The navbar includes links to the three main sections. A carousel is used below the header with large images of cats that highlight the reason for the shelter and quickly cnofirm what this site is all about - cats.

The "Who we are" section quickly gives the user information on when the shelter was established, it's purpose and where it is. This is enhanced with an image of the shelter and some of the volunteers.

The "Adopt a cat" section gives an explanation of the process of adoption followed by a set of images of indiviual cats awaiting adoption along with a description of each. 

The "Support us" section details three ways users can contirbute to the shelter, through cash and goods donations and adoption. Each point is illustrated by icons.

This then leads on to the "Contact Us" form where users can enquire about adopting a cat or submit any questions they may have.

Below that the user can access links to social media.

The footer contains contact details such as telephone number and address along with a link back to the top of the page.
